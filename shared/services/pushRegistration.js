/**
 * Expo push token registration (claude.md §45).
 *
 * The server half of push has been complete for a long time: push.service.js
 * chunks through expo-server-sdk, offloads to the BullMQ notifications queue,
 * writes the in-app Notification row, deletes tokens Expo reports as
 * DeviceNotRegistered, and honours User.notificationsEnabled. The endpoint to
 * register a token has existed at POST /users/me/push-token since the beginning.
 *
 * Nothing ever called it. Neither app depended on `expo-notifications`, so
 * `push_tokens` had zero rows and `deliverUserNotification` hit
 * `if (!messages.length) return;` on every single call — Expo was never
 * contacted and no push has ever been sent. This module is the missing half.
 *
 * It is deliberately dumb and defensive. Push is an enhancement: a farmer whose
 * device refuses permission, whose Play Services are broken, or who is on web
 * must still get a working app. Every failure path here logs in development and
 * resolves, never throws.
