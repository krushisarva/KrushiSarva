/**
 * BullMQ workers — the consumer side that actually performs queued jobs.
 *
 * `startWorkers()` spins up one Worker per registered queue, each pulling jobs
 * and dispatching to the handler in processors.js with bounded concurrency.
 * Run it two ways:
 *   - In-process (default): server.js calls startWorkers() after listen, so a
 *     single-service deploy processes jobs with no extra infra.
 *   - Standalone: `npm run worker` (src/worker.js) runs ONLY workers, letting
 *     you scale the worker tier independently of the web tier.
 *
 * A job that throws is retried per the queue's backoff policy; exhausted jobs
 * land in the failed set (retained for triage) and are logged here.
