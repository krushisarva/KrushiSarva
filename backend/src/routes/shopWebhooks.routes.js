/**
 * Payment webhooks — the gateway's side of the conversation.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The only thing that used to tell this system a payment had succeeded was the
 * mobile app, calling /orders/confirm. On a village connection the app very
 * often cannot: the connection drops between the payment sheet closing and the
 * confirm request, the OS kills the process, or the farmer switches away. The
 * money is captured, and nobody here hears about it.
 *
 * A webhook is the channel that does not depend on the buyer's phone still being
 * alive. Razorpay retries it for 24 hours.
 *
 * ── The three rules a webhook endpoint has to obey ───────────────────────────
 * 1. VERIFY THE SIGNATURE, over the RAW BYTES. Re-serialising parsed JSON does
 *    not reproduce what was signed, so this router is mounted with express.raw
 *    ahead of the global JSON parser (see app.js).
 * 2. FAIL CLOSED. No webhook secret configured → reject everything. This endpoint
 *    can mark money as received with no authenticated user behind it.
 * 3. BE IDEMPOTENT. Redelivery is normal, not exceptional. Every event id is
 *    claimed through a UNIQUE index before any work happens, so the second
 *    delivery of `payment.captured` is a no-op instead of a second order.
 *
 * ── What it deliberately does NOT do ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * It does not create orders. By the time a webhook arrives the buyer's cart may
 * have changed, stock may have sold to someone else, and there is no delivery
 * address in the payload. Fabricating an order from a payment would produce a
 * shipment nobody chose. It records the payment against its intent; the client's
 * confirm creates the order, and reconciliation refunds anything left paid with
 * no order (refundUnorderedPayment).
