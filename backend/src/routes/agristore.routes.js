/**
 * AgriStore Routes — catalog / offers / cart / orders
 *
 * ── CATALOG SPLIT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A `products` row used to be catalog identity AND one seller's offer fused into
 * one record, with no unique constraint of any kind. Two Krushi Seva Kendras
 * listing "Mahyco Bt Cotton Seed" produced two rows and two product pages.
 * It is now three tables:
 *
 *   products         catalog identity, shared            (name, brand, images, …)
 *     └ product_variants   the sellable unit (PACK SIZE) (450 g / 1 kg)
 *         └ seller_listings   one OFFER per seller       (price, stock, geo)
 *
 * Buyer routes are keyed on the CATALOG product id; cart and orders are keyed on
 * the LISTING id, because that is the only thing that identifies whose stock is
 * being bought.
 *
 * DUAL-READ WINDOW: until the backfill has run everywhere, a product may have no
 * variants at all. Every read path below falls back to the legacy offer columns
 * in that case, so the storefront does not go blank mid-migration. Each fallback
 * is marked `DUAL-READ` and is removed at CONTRACT.
 *
 * Buyer:
 *   GET    /categories
 *   GET    /products                    ?category&search&district&featured&page&limit
 *   GET    /products/:id                catalog + winning offer
 *   GET    /products/:id/offers         every eligible offer, buy-box order
 *   GET    /cart
 *   POST   /cart                        { listingId | productId, quantity }
 *   PUT    /cart/:listingId             { quantity }
 *   DELETE /cart/:listingId
 *   POST   /orders  ·  /orders/initiate  ·  /orders/confirm
 *   GET    /orders  ·  /orders/:id  ·  PUT /orders/:id/cancel
 *   POST   /products/:id/review         { rating, comment, orderItemId }
 *
 * Seller (authenticate + requireRole SELLER|VERIFIED_FARMER|ADMIN):
 *   GET    /catalog/search              ?q&gtin&brand&categoryId
 *   POST   /catalog/products            → PENDING_QC
 *   GET    /listings                    my offers, each with buy-box status
 *   POST   /listings  ·  PATCH /listings/:id  ·  DELETE /listings/:id
 *   GET    /seller/products             (legacy shim over /listings)
 *   PUT    /seller/products/:id         (legacy shim — OFFER fields only)
 *   DELETE /seller/products/:id         (legacy shim — removes MY offer)
 *   GET    /seller/stats  ·  GET /seller/orders  ·  PUT /seller/orders/:orderId/status
