/**
 * Short-TTL cache for the per-request account check (claude.md §9 / P0-002).
 *
 * Every authenticated request ran, serially: HS256 verify → Redis GET on the jti
 * denylist → `SELECT tokenVersion, isActive FROM users WHERE id = $1`. That last
 * statement is a primary-key probe, so this is not primarily a throughput fix —
 * at the stated peak it is a couple of percent of the pool. What it removes is
 * 1–2.5 ms of serial latency from one hundred percent of traffic, and a hard
 * dependency of AUTHENTICATION on Postgres being reachable.
 *
 * The denylist GET is deliberately NOT cached. Single-device logout has to take
 * effect immediately, and that is the only mechanism that delivers it.
 *
 * ── Why invalidation is a Prisma hook and not a call at each write site ──────
 *
 * There are nine places that write `users.tokenVersion` and only two of them go
 * through bumpTokenVersion(); the other seven increment it inline, and the admin
 * ban writes `isActive` without touching tokenVersion at all. Asking each of
 * those to remember to call an invalidator is asking to be wrong later — the
 * tenth site will be written by someone who has never read this file, and the
 * failure mode is a banned account that keeps working.
 *
 * So the hook watches the DATABASE instead (see attachAuthCacheInvalidation).
 * A write cannot avoid it by being new.
 *
 * ── Staleness ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * With Redis healthy: milliseconds — the local entry is dropped on the write and
 * every other replica is told over pub/sub.
 * With Redis down: bounded by the TTL below, against an access-token lifetime of
 * 900 s that already exists by design.
