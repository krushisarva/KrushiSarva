/**
 * Firebase Phone Auth — ID-token verification.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (and why it does NOT replace otp.service.js):
 * SMS to Indian numbers requires the sender to be registered on the telecom
 * operators' DLT platform (TRAI TCCCPR). Until KrushiSarva's own DLT registration
 * is approved, MSG91 cannot deliver a single OTP — the operator drops it silently.
 * Firebase Phone Auth works today because *Google* is the DLT-registered sender.
 *
 * So this is a PARALLEL login path, not a migration:
 *   • MSG91 path  — we generate the OTP, hash it, verify it, own the lockout.
 *   • Firebase path — Google generates, sends and verifies the OTP; we only
 *     verify the resulting ID token and mint our own session.
 *
 * otp.service.js is deliberately untouched. When DLT approval lands, flip
 * FIREBASE_AUTH_ENABLED off and the MSG91 path is exactly as it was.
 *
 * TRUST MODEL — read before changing anything here:
 * The ID token is a Google-signed JWT. verifyIdToken() checks the signature
 * against Google's rotating public keys, the issuer, the audience (our project),
 * and expiry. A client cannot forge one. But we trust it ONLY for the single
 * claim we need — `phone_number` — and we re-normalize that through our own
 * phone validator before it reaches the database. Nothing else in the token
 * (name, picture, uid) is allowed to influence the account we issue tokens for.

 * of the SIM within maxAgeSeconds.
