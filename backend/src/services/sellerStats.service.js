/**
 * Seller dashboard stats — precomputed cached rollup (CACHE-6).
 *
 * The seller dashboard (`GET /agristore/seller/stats`) shows totals that get
 * heavier every day: the revenue/units figure SUMs every order item the seller
 * has EVER sold. Recomputing that on each dashboard load means a full aggregate
 * scan of an ever-growing table on a hot, interactive path.
 *
 * Instead we keep a rollup in Redis:
 *   - reads are cache-aside (precomputed value served on a hit; computed +
 *     cached on a miss), so after the first load a dashboard never re-runs the
 *     aggregate within the TTL window;
 *   - a periodic leader-locked cron (see server.js) re-warms the rollups of
 *     sellers who actually use the dashboard, so reads keep hitting precomputed
 *     values and the figures stay fresh within the refresh interval;
 *   - the TTL is the safety net: if the refresh cron or Redis leader is down,
 *     entries lapse and the next read recomputes rather than serving forever-
 *     stale data.
 *
 * Fail-open: when Redis is unavailable we compute directly (no caching, no
 * errors), exactly like the rest of the cache layer — the dashboard always works.
 *
 * Eventually consistent by design: a freshly created product or completed sale
 * shows up within one refresh interval (~minutes), which is fine for a stats
 * dashboard. Paths needing exact live numbers should query the DB directly.
