/**
 * Motion hooks — accessible, battery-aware animation.
 *
 * Two problems these fix in the seller screens:
 *
 *  1. "Reduce Motion" was ignored. The shared motion.js caches the preference
 *     in a module variable that React never re-reads, so a user who enables the
 *     OS setting still got sliding, pulsing, glowing everything.
 *
 *  2. Decorative `Animated.loop(...)` calls (the live dot, the FAB ring, the
 *     profile avatar halo) were started once and never stopped. They kept
 *     running while the screen was covered by another route and while the app
 *     sat in the background — an animation frame every 16ms, forever.
