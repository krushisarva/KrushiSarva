# Current Optimization Progress

## Current Item

Working the 79-section directive audit. The audit corrected this document: the
previous version claimed "the §71 backlog is drained", and it was not — three
items were still open in code (PERF-042). Treat that as the reason this section
now names what is OPEN rather than what is finished.

## Where the directive actually stands

All 80 sections audited, each verdict independently challenged (§51–61's
challenge pass died mid-run, so those verdicts are unverified).

| Verdict | Count |
|---|---:|
| DONE | 27 |
| PARTIAL | 42 |
| NOT_DONE | 0 |
| ONGOING_POLICY (rules, not tasks) | 11 |

Nothing is untouched; 42 sections have a tail. **Four are genuinely large and
are not close:** §12 signed direct upload, §62 the six load-test workflows
including Socket.IO, §71's per-area sweep across 25 product areas, and §74 which
depends on those.

## Status

Every item on the original P0/P1 list is closed. The remaining work is the §71
per-feature sweep and the two things that need something this environment does
not have: production `pg_stat_user_indexes` (index drops, §18) and a staging
environment with mocked AI providers (load testing, §62/§63).

## Current Feature

None in progress. The last item was PERF-045 (COMPLETE): PIN code → location
via India Post, behind one cached, breaker-guarded endpoint, wired into every
location form in both apps. The batch before it covered pagination
correctness, seller metrics, AI history read cost, upload memory, and mobile
start-up cost.

## Two lessons from this batch worth keeping

**Query-shape defects are invisible to behavioural tests.** PERF-033 and
PERF-034 both return the CORRECT answer by the wrong route — `distinct` resolved
in the client, an aggregate uncorrelated to the page. Every value assertion
passes before and after. Demonstrated rather than argued: restoring the
`_count` bug leaves all four behavioural tests green and fails only the two
query-shape ones. Where a fix changes cost rather than output, the test has to
observe the SQL.

**A test that runs only in the ambient environment can keep lying.** PERF-031's
UTC control passes WITH the bug restored. Had the suite tested only in the
machine's own timezone, CI would have stayed green while cursor pagination was
broken for every developer outside UTC.

## What was discovered

The session opened by establishing a baseline, then working the P0 list in the
order that makes later work measurable rather than in severity order.

**The suite was the first item, and it paid for itself immediately.** 37–38 tests
failed across 7–8 suites, flakily. Twenty-eight were stale assertions expecting HTTP
422 from a validator that has always answered 400 — measured, not assumed: flipping
the middleware made it *worse* (38 → 50). Under that noise were four real defects,
two of which no test could report because the phone fixture could not generate unique
numbers, so the suites asserting *the marketplace does not oversell a slot* and *does
not lose a rating update* had never executed once.

With the fixture fixed, both immediately failed:

- The booking race produced **1 booking and 9 HTTP 500s**. Isolation was working —
  nothing double-booked — but the losers were told the server had failed, and a 5xx is
  what the mobile client retries. `withSerializableRetry` already existed and guarded
  six AgriStore paths; rent booking had never been wrapped. Now 1 × 201, 9 × 409.
- Five concurrent reviews reproducibly left `ratingCount` at **3, not 5** — a lost
  update on the two columns that order the storefront and feed the buy box.

Then the adversarial recon pass over the remaining audit backlog found a defect **no
audit dimension had opened**: legacy products could be **oversold without limit**.
`applyStockDeltas` — the only function that writes `products.stock` — had zero call
sites, so the pre-backfill checkout branch validated stock against a number no order
ever moved. 20 of 67 products in the dev database take that branch.

The recon pass also refuted several *fix plans* while confirming their findings, which
is the more valuable half: hardening the socket handshake alone would cause a client
reconnect storm (PERF-005), and the obvious queue fix would break every queued job in
production via `worker.js` (PERF-008). Both traps are recorded in `FINDINGS.md`.

## Tests

| Suite | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| backend (`npm test`, no flags) | 7–8 suites / 37–38 failing → then 143 failing in parallel | **108 suites / 0 failing, 1275 passing** |
| fastapi (`pytest tests`) | 4 failing / 311 passing | **337 passing** |
| frontend + shared (`npx jest`) | 9 suites / 175 passing | **14 suites / 212 passing** |
| admin (`tsc --noEmit`, `vite build`) | green | green |

Two new suites were confirmed to **fail with the fix reverted** and pass with it
restored, so they pin their properties rather than merely accompanying them.

## Metrics

Behavioural, measured locally — no production telemetry is available:

- Rent booking under 10-way contention: **9 × 500 → 9 × 409**.
- Review aggregate under 5-way contention: **ratingCount 3 → 5**, 12/12 runs.
- `GET /farms/:id/financial-summary` with any unrecorded cost: **500 → 200**.
- Legacy product stock after an order: **unchanged → decremented**; the last unit can
  no longer be sold twice.
- Chat inbox last-message lookup: **6,000 rows read → 30**; `DISTINCT ON` 3.616 ms →
  `LATERAL` **0.163 ms**, and now O(page) rather than O(message history).
- Chat inbox unread count: 7,474 rows / 2,075 buffers / 12.1 ms → 4,771 / 581 / 5.5 ms,
  and now O(page) rather than O(all unread messages on the platform).
- Celery scan persistence: **1 of 30 tasks succeeded → 30 of 30**, Postgres backends
  flat at 3 (a naive per-task pool rebuild reached 29).
- "Scans queued, no worker" is now the only one of four worker states that reports
  `degraded`; it previously reported `ok`.
- Admin broadcast fan-out: 5,000 concurrent enqueues → bounded to 25; the inline
  fail-open path is capped and sheds best-effort work instead of the API.
- A banned or logged-out user could previously hold a socket indefinitely; the
  handshake now refuses one and the sweep closes an existing one within a tick.
- Buy-box: **6 offer queries → 1** for a six-variant product, same winner throughout.
- Consent: **320 rows read → 8**, identical verdict per purpose.
- Admin dashboard: 16 aggregates → **0 on a warm read**.
- Auth: **50 authenticated requests → 1 user read** (98% hit rate); a plain
  `prisma.user.update({isActive:false})` still 401s the next request.
- Comments replies: Seq Scan 8.31 ms → bitmap index scan **0.79 ms**.
- Community feed: 13.07 ms with a sort → **0.14 ms**, no sort.
- Celery scan persistence: 1 of 30 tasks succeeded → **30 of 30**, connections flat at 3.
- i18n: seven regional bundles (692 KB) no longer evaluated at cold start.
- Backend suite wall clock: ~30 s, unchanged.

## Next item — what is genuinely left

Ranked by effort-to-impact, from the §0–79 audit:

**Medium, worth doing next**
- **§45 push** — the server half is complete and correct; ZERO pushes have ever
  been sent, because neither app depends on `expo-notifications`. The blocker is
  client registration, not the pipeline. Receipt polling (PERF-037) stays
  deferred until that lands.
- **§47 payload** — `GET /farms/:farmId` selects crop cycles with no `select`,
  pulling 8 unbounded JSON log columns plus `weatherHistory`. Product detail
  ships 10 full review rows on every open when a paginated `/reviews` already
  exists.
- **§64 targets** — no crash-reporting SDK exists in either app, so
  "crash-free users > 99.5%" cannot be produced even in principle. Nothing
  blocks adding one.

**Large, and honestly not close**
- **§12** signed direct upload — every scan byte still transits Express as
  base64.
- **§62/§63** — four of six workflows have no coverage; chat/Socket.IO is
  entirely unmeasured. The AI scenario needs a mock provider so a run does not
  spend real Gemini money. That is buildable here, not blocked.
- **§71** — 13 of 25 product areas have no per-area sweep record.
- **§74** — 1 not started (direct media upload), 1 prepared-not-deployed
  (PgBouncer), 9 partial.

**Genuinely blocked on this environment**
- **§18 index drops** — need production `pg_stat_user_indexes`. One is *proven*
  subsumed by query plan (PERF-028) and still not dropped, because §18 says a
  structural argument alone is not enough.

**Blocked on something this environment does not have — not on effort:**
- **§18 index drops** need `pg_stat_user_indexes` from production. ~40 of 284
  index declarations look prefix-subsumed or duplicated. One of them
  (`reviews.userId`, PERF-028) is now *proven* subsumed by query plan rather than
  suspected — and still not dropped, because §18 is explicit that a structural
  argument alone is not enough for a production index.
- **§62/§63 load testing under AI load** still needs mocked providers so a run
  does not spend real Gemini money. The read paths ARE now measured — see
  `LOAD-AND-PROFILE.md`: 5,028 rps on the storefront at 100 concurrent, zero
  errors to 2,000 concurrent, DB connections flat at 13. The AI path is the one
  scenario deliberately omitted rather than approximated.

**Known and deliberately deferred:** PERF-020 (the 676 KB i18n backfill is still
eager — splitting it means changing the generator), and the Expo receipt-polling
half of §45.

## A note on the test suite — now resolved (PERF-027)

The previous version of this section recorded three DB-backed suites each
failing once, never reproducing, cause unknown, hypothesis "shared-schema
contention between suites".

The hypothesis was right and the mechanism is now known. Every DB-backed suite
truncates all tables in `afterAll` against one shared database. Nothing enforced
serial execution: the CI workflow passed `--runInBand`, the `test` script did
not. Running `npm test` plainly produced **143 failures**, stably — the same 143
twice, which reads as a real regression rather than a harness problem, and cost
an hour of hunting through a diff before the flag explained it.

`maxWorkers: 1` now lives in the jest config, so `npm test`, `npx jest <file>`
and CI all mean the same thing. The intermittent single-suite failures were the
mild version of the same collision.

**Method note worth keeping:** the tell was that the failure count was
*identical* across runs while the failing *suite* set changed. Deterministic
count plus non-deterministic attribution is a harness signature, not a code
signature.
